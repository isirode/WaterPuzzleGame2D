# Water puzzle game 2D

## Known issues

Do not use the templates : this reset the tags, the layers as well. Furthermore, it duplicates / make prebab variants of the used prefabs, but in the scene, it will redirect you to the variants.
That can be difficult to see that you have not modifie the main prebab, causing unexpected bugs.
Duplicate the scene instead.

Do not set the layer of water particle prebabs, it seem to make the shader water effect to bug.
